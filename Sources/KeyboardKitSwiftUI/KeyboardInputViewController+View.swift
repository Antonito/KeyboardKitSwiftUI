     Remove all subviews then add a `SwiftUI` view that pins
     to the edges and resizes the extension to fit that view.
     
     When this function is called, the input view controller
     will convert its current `keyboardContext` object to an
     `ObservableKeyboardContext` then provide it to the view
     as an `@EnvironmentObject`.
     
     The function will also setup another environment object
     for `SystemKeyboardStyle` and provide it to the view as
     an `@EnvironmentObject`. You can change the style for a
     view or an entire hierarchy, by injecting another style
     as environment object.
