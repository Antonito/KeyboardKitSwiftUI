     Call this function to make this extension automatically
     resize the keyboard view when the keyboard type changes.
     You must provide a block that returns the keyboard, and
     a store where the keyboard type publisher's cancellable
     will be stored.
     
     `NOTE` This is quite clunky now, since the main library
     doesn't target iOS 13, which means that it cannot refer
     to SwiftUI or Combine and therefore cannot have a store
     for observables in the view controller base class. This
     will be improved in KK 4.0, when the two libraries will
     merge and the deployment target will be raised to 13.
