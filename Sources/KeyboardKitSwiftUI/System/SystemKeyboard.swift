/**
 This view mimics native system keyboards, like the standard
 alphabetic, numeric and symbolic keyboards.
 
 You can provide the keyboard with any `KeyboardLayout`. The
 leyboard will then present the layout rows in separate rows `SystemKeyboardButtonRow`
 aim to present the actions as closely as
 possible to how they would appear in a native keyboard. Any
 styling is done in `SystemKeyboardButtonRow` and any nested
 views it may use.
