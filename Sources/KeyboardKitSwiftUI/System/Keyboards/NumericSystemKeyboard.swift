/**
 This view mimics a numeric system keyboard, with three rows
 of input actions, a bottom bar and an optional topmost view.
 
 The view takes an `inputSet`, which determines which inputs
 the keyboard will have and an optional `topmostView`, which
 will be added as a topmost toolbar.
 
 `IMPORTANT` This is not flexible enough to be correct for a
 lot of countries, since I have just based it on English and
 Swedish keyboards. If it doesn't meet your needs, please do
 let me know how to make a more universally viable approach.
